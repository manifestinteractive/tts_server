    2. **Global Filters**: Control what text/characters can be processed system-wide
    3. **Version Compatibility**: Manage how API responses are formatted
    4. **Playback Behavior**: Configure how generated audio is handled

    ### üéØ Common Use Cases:
    - Setting system-wide language preferences
    - Configuring output file naming conventions
    - Managing text filtering and character support
    - Controlling audio playback behavior

    ## üéØ Understanding API Defaults

    API defaults determine how AllTalk behaves when specific parameters are omitted from API requests. Think of them as your system's "automatic" settings.

    ### How Defaults Work:
    1. When an API request includes a specific parameter, it overrides the default
    2. When a parameter is omitted, the system uses the value configured here
    3. Defaults apply to all API calls unless explicitly overridden

    ## üéØ Example Scenarios:

    **Language Selection:**
    ```plaintext
    # With language in request:
    POST /tts {"text": "Hello", "language": "fr"}
    ‚Üí Uses French, ignoring default

    # Without language:
    POST /tts {"text": "Hello"}
    ‚Üí Uses default language set in API Settings
    ```

    **Text Filtering:**
    ```plaintext
    # With filter specified:
    POST /tts {"text": "<text>", "filter": "html"}
    ‚Üí Uses HTML filtering

    # Without filter:
    POST /tts {"text": "<text>"}
    ‚Üí Uses default filter setting
    ```

    ## üéØ Important Notes:
    - Default settings affect ALL API calls
    - Changes require server restart to take effect
    - Monitor logs when changing defaults to ensure desired behavior
    - Test API calls after changing defaults to verify results

    ## üê≥ Docker IP/URL Configuration

    When running AllTalk in a Docker environment, you need to set the correct API address where the AllTalk API/TTS engine can be reached. This is necessary because:

    1. AllTalk runs as two separate components:
    - The TTS API server (handles text-to-speech generation)
    - The Gradio web interface (handles user interaction)

    2. For these components to communicate, the Gradio interface needs to know where to find the AllTalk API server.

    ## üê≥ What to Enter
    - Provide the complete URL including protocol and port: 
    - Example: `http://127.0.0.1:7851` or `https://myserver.ontheinternet.com:7851`
    - This should be the address where AllTalk's API server is accessible via LAN/Internet
    - The address may change each time you restart your Docker environment

    ## üê≥ When to Update
    - After starting AllTalk in Docker
    - If you're using a tunneling service
    - If your server's IP or domain changes
    - If you modify AllTalk's API port or port forwarding settings

    ## üê≥ Troubleshooting
    Enable `debug_gradio_IP` in your settings to see detailed connection information:

    ```
    [AllTalk TTS] Debug debug_gradio_IP Running on Docker is: True
    [AllTalk TTS] Debug debug_gradio_IP Running on Google is: False
    [AllTalk TTS] Debug debug_gradio_IP Base URL is set as  : http://127.0.0.1:7851/api/stop-generation
    ```

    This shows your current environment and the exact URLs being used for API communication.

    NARRATOR = """
    ## Understanding the Narrator Function

    ### Please note detailed explnations can be found on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki)

    The Narrator function is a powerful feature in AllTalk that enables dynamic voice switching between character dialogue and narration. This creates a more immersive experience, similar to an audiobook where different voices are used for narration and character speech.
    """

    NARRATOR1 = """
    ## How It Works

    When enabled, the Narrator function analyzes your text and identifies three distinct types of content:

    1. **Narrated Text**
    Text enclosed in asterisks is treated as narration. For example:
    `*The wind howled through the empty streets*`
    This would be spoken using your selected narrator voice.

    2. **Character Text**
    Text enclosed in quotation marks is treated as character dialogue. For example:
    `"I've been waiting for you to arrive"`
    This would be spoken using your selected character voice.

    3. **Unenclosed Text**
    Any text not enclosed in either asterisks or quotation marks is handled according to your Text-Not-Inside settings.

    ## Narrator Mode Settings

    The Narrator function offers three operational modes:

    ### Enabled
    - Narrated text (in asterisks) uses the narrator voice
    - Character text (in quotes) uses the character voice
    - Unenclosed text follows Text-Not-Inside settings

    ### Enabled (Silent)
    - Narrated text is recognized but not spoken
    - Character text is spoken normally
    - Useful for including stage directions or context
    - Perfect for scripts or roleplaying scenarios

    ### Disabled
    - All text uses the character voice
    - No special handling of asterisks
    - Simplest processing mode

    ## Managing Unenclosed Text

    The Text-Not-Inside setting determines how text without markers is handled:

    ### As Character
    - Treats unmarked text as character dialogue
    - Useful for casual conversation formats
    - Spoken in the character voice

    ### As Narrator
    - Treats unmarked text as narration
    - Good for story-focused content
    - Spoken in the narrator voice

    ### Silent
    - Unmarked text is not spoken
    - Useful for formatting or instructions
    - Allows for hidden context or notes
    """

    NARRATOR2 = """
    ## Practical Examples

    Here's how different combinations work:

    ### Story Format
    `*Sarah entered the coffee shop, the aroma of fresh coffee filling the air* "I'd love a cappuccino, please" *she said softly*`

    - Narration describes the scene and actions
    - Dialogue presents the character's words
    - Clear separation of voice roles

    ### Script Format
    `*[Scene: A dimly lit room]* "Who's there?" *[Sound of footsteps]*`

    Using Enabled (Silent) for narration:
    - Stage directions remain silent
    - Only dialogue is spoken
    - Maintains script structure

    ## Tips for Best Results

    1. **Consistent Formatting**
    - Use clear markers for different text types
    - Maintain formatting throughout your text
    - Check for matching asterisks and quotes

    2. **Voice Selection**
    - Choose distinct voices for narrator and character
    - Consider the tone of your content
    - Test combinations before long generations

    3. **Text Structure**
    - Keep narration concise
    - Break up long passages
    - Mix narration and dialogue naturally

    4. **Common Patterns**
    - Use narration for scene-setting
    - Include character actions in narration
    - Keep dialogue natural and flowing

    ## Advanced Usage

    For more complex projects:

    1. **Silent Annotations**
    - Use Enabled (Silent) for stage directions
    - Include timing or performance notes
    - Add context without affecting audio

    2. **Mixed Content**
    - Combine different text types effectively
    - Use narration for transitions
    - Balance dialogue and description

    3. **API Integration**
    - Set defaults in the API
    - Override settings as needed
    - Maintain consistent formatting

    Remember that the Narrator function is designed to be flexible. Experiment with different combinations of settings to find what works best for your specific needs.

    ## Additional Notes

    - All global settings for the API endpoint can be configured within the AllTalk interface under Global Settings > AllTalk API Defaults.
    - TTS engine-specific settings, such as voices to use or engine parameters, can be set on an engine-by-engine basis in TTS Engine Settings > TTS Engine of your choice.
    - Although you can send all variables/settings, the loaded TTS engine will only support them if it is capable. For example, you can request a TTS generation in Russian, but if the TTS model that is loaded only supports English, it will only generate English-sounding text-to-speech.
    - Voices sent in the request have to match the voices available within the TTS engine loaded. Generation requests where the voices don't match will result in nothing being generated and possibly an error message.
    """

    API_STREAMING = """
    ## Please note detailed explnations, along with code samples can be found on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki)

    This endpoint allows you to generate and stream TTS audio directly for real-time playback. It does not support narration and will generate an audio stream, not a file. It also does not support the RVC pipeline.

    The API also returns a JSON object with the following property:

    | Property | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `output_file_path` | The name of the output file. |

    Example response:

    ```json
    {
        "output_file_path": "stream_output.wav"
    }
    ```

    ## JavaScript Example for Streaming Playback

    Here's an example of how to use the streaming endpoint in JavaScript for real-time audio playback:

    ```javascript
    const text = "Here is some text";
    const voice = "female_01.wav";
    const language = "en";
    const outputFile = "stream_output.wav";
    const encodedText = encodeURIComponent(text);
    const streamingUrl = `http://localhost:7851/api/tts-generate-streaming?text=${encodedText}&voice=${voice}&language=${language}&output_file=${outputFile}`;
    const audioElement = new Audio(streamingUrl);
    audioElement.play();
    ```

    ## Additional Notes

    1. **No Narration Support**: This endpoint does not support the narrator function available in the standard TTS generation endpoint.

    2. **No RVC Pipeline**: The streaming endpoint does not support the RVC (Real-time Voice Conversion) pipeline.

    3. **Real-time Playback**: This endpoint is designed for scenarios where you need immediate audio output, such as interactive applications or real-time text-to-speech conversions.

    4. **Browser Compatibility**: The streaming functionality works well with modern web browsers that support audio streaming. Make sure to test compatibility with your target browsers. Firefox may NOT work.

    5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in your client-side code to manage potential issues with the audio stream.

    6. **Bandwidth Considerations**: Streaming audio requires a stable network connection. Consider the bandwidth requirements when implementing this in your application, especially for longer text inputs.

    7. **File Output**: Although the API returns an `output_file_path`, the primary purpose of this endpoint is streaming. The file output is a side effect and might not be necessary for all use cases.

    8. **Voice Selection**: Ensure that the voice you specify in the request is available in your AllTalk configuration. Using an unavailable voice may result in an error or default voice selection.

    9. **Language Support**: The language support for streaming TTS generation is the same as the standard TTS generation. Refer to the supported languages list in the standard TTS generation documentation.
    """

    API_CONTROL = """
    ## Please note detailed explnations, along with code samples can be found on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki)

    This set of endpoints allows you to control various aspects of the AllTalk server, including stopping generation, reloading configurations, switching models, and adjusting performance settings.

    ## 1. Stop Generation Endpoint

    Interrupt the current TTS generation process, if the currently loaded TTS engine & method supports it. Currently only XTTS Streaming supports this.

    - **URL**: `http://{ipaddress}:{port}/api/stop-generation`
    - **Method**: `PUT`

    ### Response

    ```json

    ```

    ## 5. Switch Low VRAM Endpoint

    Enable or disable Low VRAM mode. Will only benefit TTS Engines that support CUDA.

    - **URL**: `http://{ipaddress}:{port}/api/lowvramsetting`
    - **Method**: `POST`

    ### Parameters

    | Parameter | Type | Description |
    |-----------|------|-------------|
    | `new_low_vram_value` | boolean | `True` to enable Low VRAM mode, `False` to disable |

    ### Response

    ```json
    {
        "status": "lowvram-success"
    }
    ```

    ### Example Request

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:7851/api/lowvramsetting?new_low_vram_value=True"
    ```

    ## Usage Tips

    1. Use the Stop Generation endpoint when you need to cancel an ongoing TTS generation process.
    2. The Reload Configuration endpoint is useful after making changes to the AllTalk configuration or adding new voice models.
    3. Use the Reload/Swap Model endpoint to change the active TTS model dynamically.
    4. The DeepSpeed and Low VRAM endpoints allow you to adjust performance settings based on your system's capabilities and current needs.
    5. Always check the response status to ensure your configuration changes were applied successfully.
    6. After making configuration changes, it's a good practice to use the status endpoints (from the AllTalk Server and TTS Engine Status API) to verify the new state of the server.

    API_STATUS = """
    ## Please note detailed explnations, along with code samples can be found on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki)

    This set of endpoints allows you to retrieve information about the current state of the AllTalk server and its loaded TTS engine, including available voices, settings, and server readiness.

    ## 1. Server Ready Status Endpoint

    Check if the Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine has started and is ready to accept requests.

    - **URL**: `http://{ipaddress}:{port}/api/ready`
    - **Method**: `GET`

    ### Response

    | Status | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `Ready` | The TTS engine is ready to process requests. |
    | `Unloaded` | The TTS engine is restarting or not ready. |

    ### Example Request

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:7851/api/ready"
    ```

    ### Notes
    - Useful when performing reload model/engine requests.
    - You can poll this endpoint to confirm a "Ready" status.
    - A "Ready" status only indicates that the engine has loaded, not that all models are correctly loaded.

    ## 2. Standard Voices List Endpoint

    Retrieve a list of available voices for the currently loaded TTS engine and model.

    - **URL**: `http://{ipaddress}:{port}/api/voices`
    - **Method**: `GET`

    ### Response

    ```json
    {
        "status": "success",
        "voices": ["voice1", "voice2", "voice3"]
    }
    ```

    ### Example Request

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:7851/api/voices"
    ```

    ### Notes
    - If the currently loaded TTS engine does not load a model directly (e.g., Piper), the models themselves will be displayed as voices.

    ## 3. RVC Voices List Endpoint

    Retrieve a list of available RVC voices for further processing your TTS with the RVC pipeline. If RVC is disabled on the server or there are no available voices, the voice returned will just be "Disabled". "Disabled" will always be added as a voice to the list, even if RVC is enabled on the server. This way Disabled can be chosen as a voice to bypass RVC processing, even when RVC is enabled server side.

    - **URL**: `http://{ipaddress}:{port}/api/rvcvoices`
    - **Method**: `GET`

    ### Response

    ```json
    {
        "status": "success",
        "voices": ["Disabled", "folder1\\voice1.pth", "folder2\\voice2.pth", "folder3\\voice3.pth"]
    }
    ```

    ### Example Request

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:7851/api/rvcvoices"
    ```

    ### Notes
    - `Disabled` will always be included in the list.
    - If the RVC pipeline is globally disabled in AllTalk, `Disabled` will be the only item in the list.
    - Index files matching their RVC voices will not be displayed; if an index file exists for an RVC voice, it will be automatically selected during generation.

    ## 4. Current Settings Endpoint

    Retrieve the current settings of the currently loaded TTS engine.

    - **URL**: `http://{ipaddress}:{port}/api/currentsettings`
    - **Method**: `GET`

    ### Response

    The response is a JSON object containing various settings. Here are some key fields:

    | Field | Description |

    "multimodel_capable": true
    }
    ```



    ### Notes
    - The response includes many more fields detailing the capabilities and current settings of the loaded TTS engine.
    - Use this endpoint to dynamically adjust your application's UI based on the current capabilities of the loaded TTS engine.

    ## Usage Tips

    1. Check the server readiness before making other API calls.
    2. Use the voices and RVC voices endpoints to populate selection menus in your application.
    3. Use the current settings endpoint to adjust your application's features based on the capabilities of the loaded TTS engine.
    4. Regularly poll these endpoints if you need to maintain an up-to-date status of the AllTalk server in a long-running application.
    """

    API_OPENAPI = """
    ## Please note detailed explnations, along with code samples can be found on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki)

    AllTalk provides an endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Speech v1 API. This allows for easy integration with existing systems designed to work with OpenAI's text-to-speech service.

    ## Endpoint Details

    - **URL**: `http://{ipaddress}:{port}/v1/audio/speech`
    - **Method**: `POST`
    - **Content-Type**: `application/json`

    ## Request Format

    The request body must be a JSON object with the following fields:

    | Field | Type | Description |
    |-------|------|-------------|
    | `model` | string | The TTS model to use. Currently ignored, but required in the request. |
    | `input` | string | The text to generate audio for. Maximum length is 4096 characters. |
    | `voice` | string | The voice to use when generating the audio. |
    | `response_format` | string | (Optional) The format of the audio. Audio will be transcoded to the requested format. |
    | `speed` | float | (Optional) The speed of the generated audio. Must be between 0.25 and 4.0. Default is 1.0. |

    ### Supported Voices

    The `voice` parameter supports the following values:

    - `alloy`
    - `echo`
    - `fable`
    - `nova`
    - `onyx`
    - `shimmer`

    These voices are mapped to AllTalk voices on a one-to-one basis within the AllTalk Gradio interface, on a per-TTS engine basis.

    ## Example cURL Request

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:7851/v1/audio/speech" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
            "model": "any_model_name",
            "input": "Hello, this is a test.",
            "voice": "nova",
            "response_format": "wav",
            "speed": 1.0
            }'
    ```

    ## Response

    The endpoint returns the generated audio data directly in the response body.

    ## Additional Notes

    - There is no capability within this API to specify a language. The response will be in whatever language the currently loaded TTS engine and model support.
    - If RVC is globally enabled in AllTalk settings and a voice other than "Disabled" is selected for the character voice, the chosen RVC voice will be applied after the TTS is generated and before the audio is transcoded and sent back out.

    ## Voice Remapping

    You can remap the 6 OpenAI voices to any voices supported by the currently loaded TTS engine using the following endpoint:

    - **URL**: `http://{ipaddress}:{port}/api/openai-voicemap`
    - **Method**: `POST`
    - **Content-Type**: `application/json`

    ### Example Voice Remapping Request

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:7851/api/openai-voicemap" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
            "alloy": "female_01.wav",
            "echo": "female_01.wav",
            "fable": "female_01.wav",
            "nova": "female_01.wav",
            "onyx": "male_01.wav",
            "shimmer": "male_02.wav"
            }'
    ```

    Note: The Gradio interface will not reflect these changes until AllTalk is reloaded, as Gradio caches the list.

    WHISPER_HELP = """
    ## üé§ Dictate Help

    The Dictate feature enables real-time speech-to-text conversion using OpenAI's Whisper models. This guide explains all available settings and provides recommendations for optimal use.
    """

    WHISPER_HELP1 = """
    ## üìù Basic Settings

    **Known Bug** After unloading the model you have to **refresh the page** to start trancription again. Believed to be a Gradio bug/issue.

    ### Whisper Model Selection
    - **Purpose**: Determines the model size and accuracy used for transcription
    - **Options**:
        * `tiny` (0.5GB VRAM): Fastest, basic accuracy, good for testing
        * `base` (1GB VRAM): Good balance of speed and accuracy
        * `small` (2GB VRAM): Better accuracy, suitable for clear speech
        * `medium` (4GB VRAM): High accuracy, handles accents better
        * `large-v3` (10GB VRAM): Best accuracy, handles complex audio
        * `large-v3-turbo` (10GB VRAM): Fast high-quality processing
        * `turbo` (10GB VRAM): Fastest high-quality option

    **Recommendation**: Start with a `turbo` model for speed, or `base` if VRAM is very limited and `large-v3`for best quality<br>
    **Note**: Ensure your GPU has sufficient VRAM. Running out of VRAM will cause crashes

    ### Language Settings
    - **Language**: Primary language for transcription
    - **Source Language**: Original speech language if translating
    - **Translate to English**: Converts source language to English
    - **Recommendation**: Set both to match your speech language unless translation needed

    1. **Language**:
        - Sets the language model that Whisper uses to decode speech into text
        - Used as the OUTPUT language for transcription
        - Controls what language the text will be written in
        - Example: Set to English to get English text output

    2. **Source Language**:
        - Tells Whisper what language to expect in the input audio
        - Helps the model better recognize speech patterns and phonemes
        - Improves accuracy when processing non-English speech
        - Example: Set Source Language to French when speaker is speaking French

    ### Language Use Case Examples:
    **Same Language Transcription**: Set both to same language (e.g., English/English for English speech to English text)<br>
    **Translation**: Set Source Language to speaker's language (e.g., French) and Language to desired output language (e.g., English)<br>
    **Best Accuracy**: Always set Source Language to match the actual spoken language, even when translating

    **Note**: If "Translate to English" is enabled, it overrides the Language setting and forces English output.

    ## Output Format
        - **Types**:
            * `txt`: Simple text file
            * `srt`: Subtitle format with timestamps
            * `json`: Detailed format with metadata
        - **Location**: Files saved to `transcriptions/live_dictation/`
        - **Naming**: `[prefix]_dictation_[timestamp].[format]`

    ## üéöÔ∏è Advanced Settings

    ### Audio Processing
    - **Enable ALL Audio Enhancements**:
        * Activates **ALL** audio processing features
        * Use when recording quality needs improvement
        * The checkboxes for other settings will not show checked
        
    - **Apply Noise Reduction**:
        * Reduces background noise
        * **Recommendation**: Enable for noisy environments

    - **Apply Audio Compression**:
        * Evens out volume levels
        * **Use When**: Speaking volume varies significantly

    - **Apply Bandpass Filter**:
    The Bandpass Filter isolates frequencies within the typical range of human speech, filtering out low-frequency rumbles and high-frequency hiss or noise. This improves transcription quality in challenging environments.<br><br>
    - **‚àø Low Frequency (Hz)** *(Range: 50 - 120 Hz)*  
        - **Default Value:** 85 Hz  
        - **Lower Values (e.g., 50‚Äì70 Hz):**
            - Recommended for deeper male voices or audio with a broader vocal range.
            - Useful when preserving low vocal harmonics in clean recordings.
        - **Higher Values (e.g., 100‚Äì120 Hz):**
            - Filters out low-frequency background hums (e.g., AC noise, mic handling noise).
            - Ideal for recordings with rumble or low-frequency distortion.<br><br>

    - **‚àø High Frequency (Hz)** *(Range: 3000 - 5000 Hz)*  
        - **Default Value:** 3800 Hz  
        - **Lower Values (e.g., 3000‚Äì3500 Hz):**
            - Reduces high-pitched noise, hissing, or squeals in noisy environments.
            - Useful for telephone-quality recordings or audio with limited frequency range.
        - **Higher Values (e.g., 4000‚Äì5000 Hz):**
            - Captures more speech detail and overtones, particularly for tonal languages or professionally recorded audio.
            - Suitable for higher-quality recordings where clarity is paramount.

    **Use Bandpass Filter in Noisy Environments:** Helps focus on human speech frequencies while ignoring irrelevant noise.

    **Skip Bandpass for Pristine Audio:** For high-quality recordings, skipping this filter ensures no speech frequencies are lost.

    WHISPER_HELP2 = """
    ### Timing and Organization
    - **Add Timestamps**:
        * Adds time markers to transcription
        * Useful for long recordings
        * Format: `[HH:MM:SS] Text`

    - **Enable Speaker Diarization**:
        * Attempts to identify different speakers
        * Basic implementation - best for clear speaker transitions
        * Format: `Speaker 1: Text`

    - **Silence Threshold** *(Range: 0.001 - 0.02)*  
    This setting determines the amplitude below which audio is treated as silence. Adjusting this is essential for balancing noise filtering and capturing soft speech.  
        - **Default Value:** 0.008  
        - **Use Higher Values (e.g., 0.01‚Äì0.02):**
            - Reduces false triggers from faint background noise (e.g., air conditioners, hums).
            - Suitable for noisier environments where background noise needs to be suppressed.
        - **Use Lower Values (e.g., 0.001‚Äì0.007):**
            - Helps capture quieter or softer speech.
            - Ideal for high-quality recordings with minimal background noise.

    **Tip:** Monitor the **Audio Levels graph** during preprocessing or testing to ensure speech is detected while avoiding unnecessary noise capture. Fine-tune based on the quietest speaker in your audio.

    ### **Additional Notes for Optimization:**
    - **Experiment with Combined Settings:**
        - Pair a **higher Silence Threshold** (e.g., 0.01) with a **narrower Bandpass range** (e.g., 100‚Äì3500 Hz) in noisy environments.
        - Use a **lower Silence Threshold** (e.g., 0.005) and a **wider Bandpass range** (e.g., 50‚Äì4000 Hz) for high-quality or wide-spectrum recordings.
    - **Adapt Based on Speaker Profiles:**
        - Adjust **Low Frequency** for male vs. female speakers.
        - Raise **High Frequency** for tonal clarity in languages like Mandarin or musical recordings.
        
    ## üìä Real-Time Feedback

    ### Audio Levels Graph
    - Shows audio input strength in real-time
    - **How to Read**:
        * X-axis: Time
        * Y-axis: Audio level
        * **Good levels**: Consistent peaks without flatlines or clipping
        * **Too low**: Flat or minimal movement
        * **Too high**: Constant maximum peaks

    PROXY = """
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice
    This is an advanced feature intended for users who need to expose AllTalk services to the internet with SSL/HTTPS capabilities. If you're running AllTalk locally or don't specifically need HTTPS support, you should use the standard Gradio interface links.

    **This guide is specifically for:**
    - System administrators
    - Users **with** networking/SSL certificate experience
    - Those requiring **HTTPS for production deployments**
    - Users needing secure external access to AllTalk services    
    
    ## üéØ What is the AllTalk Proxy?

    The AllTalk Proxy system provides a secure way to expose your AllTalk instance to external networks while maintaining control and security. It acts as a protective intermediate layer between the internet and your AllTalk services. You can find much of the below information also on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki/AllTalk-SSL-Proxy-System-%E2%80%90-Technical-Guide/)
    """

    PROXY1 = """
    ### Why Use the Proxy?
    - **Security**: Adds an additional layer of protection between external users and your AllTalk instance
    - **HTTPS Support**: Enable secure, encrypted connections to your service
    - **Port Control**: Map internal services to different external ports
    - **Access Control**: Manage how your AllTalk instance is accessed from outside your network
    - **Monitoring**: Track and log all access attempts and usage

    Ideal for:
    - Exposing AllTalk to the internet safely
    - Running AllTalk in a production environment
    - Sharing your instance with team members
    - Monitoring and controlling access to your services

    ## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

    1. **Enable Master Switch**
    - Enable "Master switch/safety lockout for proxy functionality" checkbox
    - Essential first step - nothing will work without this enabled
    - It's designed as a safety mechanism to prevent accidental exposure
    - Enables all other controls

    2. **Configure Endpoints**
    - **HTTP Mode** (Default)
        - No certificates required
        - Only **HTTP** connections available
        - Less secure but simpler setup

    - **HTTPS Mode** (Optional)
        - **Requires** valid SSL certificates
        - Enables **HTTPS** connections
        - More secure but requires setup
        
    - **Certificate Quick Guide (Optional)**
        - Accepts SSL certificates (.crt/.pem) and private keys (.key)
        - Self-signed certificates work fine on the **API only**
            - But will give browser warnings
            - You may have to install Self-signed on your client machine/device

    3. **Start Operations**
    - Enable/Disable the API & Gradio proxy
    - Set desired ports for the API & Gradio proxy
    - Click "Save Settings"
    - Click "Start Service"

    4. **Stop Operations**
    - Click "Stop Service"
    - It can take 60 seconds to stop the proxy

    ## üîß Detailed Configuration Guide

    ### Master Safety Control
    The "Master switch/safety lockout for proxy functionality":
    - Acts as a global killswitch for all proxy features
    - Must be enabled for any proxy functionality to work
    - Settings are preserved when disabled
    - Prevents accidental exposure of services
    - Recommended to leave disabled when not actively using proxy features

    ## Network Architecture

    #### Port Mapping System
    The proxy creates an intelligent port-forwarding system:
    - External Ports: What the outside world sees and connects to
    - Internal Ports: Your local AllTalk services (automatically managed)
    - Auto-mapping: Internal Gradio (7852) and API (7851) ports are automatically mapped to whatever external ports you specify
    - Traffic Flow: External request ‚Üí Proxy ‚Üí Internal Service ‚Üí Proxy ‚Üí External response

    #### Port Configuration
    - **HTTP(S) Port**: External port for web interface access
    - **API Port**: External port for API access
    - Both ports must be:
        - Available on your system
        - Not blocked by firewalls
        - Different from each other
        - Different from internal ports (7851/7852)

    ## Certificate Management
    
    #### Certificate Requirements
    - **Format**: PEM or CRT format for certificate, PEM for private key
    - **Fields Required**:
    - Common Name (CN)
    - Valid dates (not expired)
    - Proper encryption strength (minimum 2048-bit RSA or equivalent)

    #### Self-Signed Certificates
    - Ok to use BUT may need to be installed on your client device too
    - The Gradio UI will **not** proxy with self-signed certificates
    - Will generate browser warnings but connections are still encrypted
    - Create your own:
    
    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
    ```

    #### How to Upload
    1. Drag and drop or click to upload both certificate and key files
    2. Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "alltalk_cert")
    3. Click "Upload Certificate"

    #### Managing Certificates
    - Delete certificates by clicking `Delete Certificates`
    - Location `/alltalk_tts/system/proxy_module/certificates`
    - System can run without certificates in HTTP mode
    - Certificates can be added/changed while system is running
    - Changes take effect on proxy restart
    - System falls back to HTTP if certificates are removed

    #### Converting Certificates
    - DER to PEM: `openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem`
    - PFX to PEM: `openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.pfx -out certificate.pem -nodes`

    ## SSL/HTTPS Configuration

    #### Understanding HTTP vs HTTPS
    - Without certificates: Only **HTTP** connections are available
    - With certificates: **HTTPS** connections enabled
    - Self-signed certificates **ONLY** work for the **API endpoint**
    - Gradio interface requires properly signed certificates
    - Each endpoint (API/Gradio) can be configured independently
        - Enabled/Disabled
        - Port number for External access

    #### Certificate Requirements
    - SSL certificate file (.crt/.pem)
    - Private key file (.key)
    - Self-signed certificates work (will trigger browser warnings)
        - But Gradio will **not** proxy with self-signed
    - **Commercial certificates recommended for production**

    #### Setup Process
    1. Obtain certificates (self-signed or commercial)
    2. Upload via Certificate Management section
    3. Enter certificate name
    4. Enable endpoint(s)
    5. Restart proxy service

    #### Getting Valid SSL Certificates
    - For production/Gradio interface use, obtain certificates from:
        - Let's Encrypt (free, trusted certificates)
        - Cloudflare (offers free SSL with their services)
        - Commercial providers (DigiCert, GlobalSign, etc.)
        - Self-signed certificates:
            - Only work with API endpoint
            - Will cause errors with Gradio interface
            - Should only be used for testing API functionality

    #### Security Notes
    - HTTP connections are unencrypted
    - HTTPS provides encryption and authentication
    - Consider using HTTPS for sensitive data
    - Browser warnings normal with self-signed certificates

    #### Troubleshooting
    - Verify certificate/key pair match
    - Check certificate expiration
    - Confirm port availability
    - Review proxy logs if issues persist

    #### Debug Options
    - **debug_proxy**: Main proxy debugging flag
    - Shows detailed proxy operations
    - Logs connection attempts
    - Shows routing decisions
    - **Important**: Requires system restart to show in console!

    #### Enabling Debug Logging
    1. Enable **debug_proxy** in interface
    2. **Must restart the system** for console logging to begin
    3. File logging begins immediately without restart
    4. Can be enabled/disabled without stopping proxy

    #### Log Locations
    - Console: Real-time viewing in interface
    - File System: `/system/proxy_module/logs/alltalk.log`
    - Debug logs: Additional detail in debug-specific files

    #### Log Rotation
    - Files rotate automatically based on size (10MB)
    - Keeps last 5 log files
    - Naming: alltalk.log, alltalk.log.1, alltalk.log.2, etc.
    - Rotation happens automatically, no user intervention needed

    #### What Gets Logged
    Different debug flags show different information:
    - **debug_proxy**: 
    ```
    [AllTalk PRX] Debug proxy New connection from 192.168.1.100
    [AllTalk PRX] Debug proxy Routing request to internal port 7852

    ```
    - **Error Messages**:
    ```
    [AllTalk PRX] Error: Port 8443 already in use
    [AllTalk PRX] Error: Certificate file not found
    [AllTalk PRX] Warning: Running without HTTPS encryption
    ```

    ## Console Interface

    #### Real-time Monitoring
    The console interface shows:
    - Active connections
    - Error messages
    - System status
    - Certificate operations
    - Debug information (if enabled and after restart)

    #### Status Indicators
    - **Active**: System is running and accepting connections
    - **Inactive**: System is stopped
    - **Error**: System encountered issues (with error details)

    #### Common Log Messages
    - `Starting proxy system`: Initial startup
    - `Certificate loaded successfully`: Cert validation passed
    - `Forwarding traffic`: Active connection handling
    - `Connection closed`: Clean disconnection
    - `Error: Port already in use`: Configuration conflict

    ## üîç Troubleshooting

    Common issues and solutions:
    1. **System won't start**
    - Check master switch is enabled
    - Verify ports are available
    - Confirm certificate validity (if using HTTPS)

    2. **Certificate issues**
    - Verify format (PEM/CRT)
    - Check expiration dates
    - Ensure key matches certificate
    - Try running without certificates first

    3. **Connection refused**
    - Check firewall settings
    - Verify ports are open
    - Confirm service is running

    4. **Debug logs not appearing in console**
    - Remember to restart after enabling **debug_proxy**
    - Check log file permissions
    - Verify log path exists

    5. **Certificate won't upload**
    - Verify file formats
    - Check file permissions
    - Try different certificate formats
    
    6. **Gradio interface not loading with HTTPS**
    - Verify you're using properly signed certificates (not self-signed)
    - Self-signed certificates will not work with Gradio interface
    - Try using HTTP mode for testing Gradio interface    

    ## üìù Best Practices

    1. **Security**
    - Use strong certificates when possible
    - Regular certificate rotation
    - Monitor logs for unusual activity
    - Log dir `system/proxy_module/logs/`
    - Disable master switch when not needed

    2. **Performance**
    - Enable debug_proxy only when needed
    - Regular log file cleanup
    - Monitor resource usage

    3. **Maintenance**
    - Regular certificate updates (if using)
    - Log file cleanup
    - System updates
    - Regular security audits

    4. **Testing**
    - Start without certificates for initial testing
    - Use self-signed certificates for development
    - Test with debug_proxy enabled initially
    - Verify all paths work before exposing to internet
