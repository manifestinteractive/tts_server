Text-generation-webui remote extension for AllTalk! 

This folder contains everything you need to set up a Text-generation-webui extension that can communicate with an AllTalk server remotely.

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1) In your Text-generation-webui's extensions folder, create a new folder and name it "alltalk_tts".
2) Take all the files from this current folder and copy them into the newly created "alltalk_tts" folder.
3) Start & Open Text-generation-webui and look for "alltalk_tts" in the list of extensions. Select alltalk_tts, save your settings and restart Text-generation-webui.
4) Text-generation-webui will restart and load the AllTalk extension. You may see an error/warning as the extension will not yet have the IP address details of your remote AllTalk server.
5) In the extension settings, enter the correct IP address and port of your AllTalk server. If your AllTalk server is running on a remote machine accessed through a secure tunnel, make sure to use "https" instead of "http".
6) After entering the server details, click on the "Refresh settings & voices" button. If the settings are correct, the extension will download all the available settings from the AllTalk server.
7) The first time you successfully generate speech using the extension, the settings will be automatically saved to a local configuration file.

Please note that if the AllTalk server you're connected to doesn't support certain settings/features, those options will be greyed out and unavailable in the extension.

Please use the "Refresh settings & voices" button to make sure the extension is in sync with your AllTalk server.
